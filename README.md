## Introduction

Welcome to my Bellabeat data analysis case study. In this case study i will perform real-world tasks of a data analyst. And in order to answer some key business questions i will follow the steps of the data analysis process:Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act. 


## About the company Bellabeat
 
**Bellabeat**,is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, and they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.

## Scenario of the Study

In this study, I will focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.

## Questions for the Analysis (Ask phase)

In this phase, I tried to better undestand the data and the problem I'm trying to solve. And to do that, I had to do more research and ask more questions:

1.What are some trends in smart device usage? How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy ? So first, the company need to better target their marketing efforts into their customer's needs based on their usage of their fitness smart devices. And then, make high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

2.Who are the main stakeholders ? The main stakeholders are Urška Sršen, Bellabeat’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer; Sando Mur, Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; And also, we need to think about and work with the rest of the Bellabeat marketing analytics team.

## Business Task

Now, after getting answers to all of my questions (during the ask phase), I'm able to define clearly the business task which is: To analyse how do Bellabeat customers use their smart devices? And then, Identify potential opportunities for growth and recommendations for the Bellabeat marketing team based on trends in smart device usage.

## Data Preparation (prepare phase)

### Data Source

The data for this case study comes from [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit), a public domain dataset available on Kaggle.This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-04.11.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. 

### Limitations

- Sample size: 30 people is not a large enough sample to be representative of all FitBit users
- Outdated: The dataset contains data from a one month period in 2016 only. For a deeper and more accurate analysis of trends, we would need data from the current year, preferably collected for an entire year to look at if trends vary during different times of year. 
- Limited: The dataset does not contain any demographic information about the users, including gender, age, or location, which would be beneficial for marketing purposes to target specific customers

### Import Data, Install, and Loading of Packages

There was a total of 18 datasets available for use. After carefully viewing all the datasets only the daily activity, intensities,weight and sleep datasets were utilized for this analysis. These CSV files were imported, and the necessary packages were installed and loaded into R Studio.

1. Load packages
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2)) 
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate)) 
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyr))
```

2. Load CSV files containing our data
```{r}
# set working directory
# setwd("C:/Users/mahaboob/Desktop/Fitabase Data 3.12.16-4.11.16")
# load files
activity<-read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
heartrate<-read.csv("heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
intensities<-read.csv("dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
sleep<-read.csv("sleepday_merged.csv")
```

3.Preview and checking the dataset
```{r}
#1.activity
str(activity)
colnames(activity)
head(activity)

#2.intensities
str(intensities)
colnames(intensities)
head(intensities)
#3.heart rate
str(heartrate)
colnames(heartrate)
head(heartrate)
#4.sleep

str(sleep)
colnames(sleep)
head(sleep)
```


##  Cleaning the dataset(Process phase)


 Here are some cleaning steps i did with the data:

1.For Activity Dataset:
```{r}
#changing ID  from numerical to nominal
activity$Id<-as.character(activity$Id)
#changed date format from char to date
activity$ActivityDate<-as.Date(activity$ActivityDate,format = "%m/%d/%Y")
#remove duplicates
activity <- activity[!duplicated(activity), ]
#checking missing values
colSums(is.na(activity))
```

2.For Intensities Dataset:
```{r}
#changing ID  from numerical to nominal
intensities$Id<-as.character(intensities$Id)
#changed date format from char to date
intensities$ActivityDay<-as.Date(intensities$ActivityDay,format="%m/%d/%Y")
#remove duplicates
intensities<-intensities[!duplicated(intensities), ]
#checking missing values
colSums(is.na(intensities))
```
3.For Heart Rate Dataset
```{r}
#changing ID  from numerical to nominal
heartrate$Id<-as.character(heartrate$Id)
#Convert Time to POSIXct
heartrate$Time <- as.POSIXct(heartrate$Time, format="%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")
#changed date format
heartrate$Date <- as.Date(heartrate$Time)
```
4. For Sleep
```{r}
#changing ID  from numerical to nominal
sleep$Id<-as.character(sleep$Id)
#changed date format from char to date
sleep$SleepDay<-as.POSIXct(sleep$SleepDay,format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")
#changed date format
sleep$Date<-as.Date(sleep$SleepDay)
```
## Summarising the dataset(Analyse phase)

### 1. Analyzing Daily activity Patterns:

a. Exploring descriptive statistics.This gives you a snapshot of how active users are.
```{r}
activity$TotalActiveMinutes <- activity$VeryActiveMinutes +
  activity$FairlyActiveMinutes +
 activity$LightlyActiveMinutes
activity %>%
  summarise(
    avg_steps = mean(TotalSteps),
    median_steps = median(TotalSteps),
    avg_calories = mean(Calories),
    avg_active_minutes = mean(TotalActiveMinutes)
  )
```
b.Create categories to understand user behavior.This helps identify which users need motivation vs. which ones are already engaged.
```{r}
 activity$ActivityLevel <- ifelse(activity$TotalSteps < 5000, "Sedentary",
                                       ifelse(activity$TotalSteps < 10000, "Moderate", "Active"))
table(activity$ActivityLevel)
```
c.To find  percentage of users meeting the 10,000-step goal
```{r}
 # Total number of records
total_records <- nrow(activity)
total_records
# Number of records meeting the 10,000-step goal
goal_met <- nrow(activity %>% filter(TotalSteps >= 10000))
goal_met
# Calculate percentage
percent_goal_met <- (goal_met / total_records) * 100
percent_goal_met
# Print result
cat("Percentage of users meeting 10,000-step goal:", round(percent_goal_met, 2), "%\n")

```
d.Correlation between movement and energy
```{r}

cor(activity$TotalSteps,activity$Calories)
cor(activity$TotalActiveMinutes, activity$Calories)

```
 
### 2. Analysing sleep behaviour
  a.Started by calculating Sleep Efficiency and categorizing sleep quality:
```{r}
 sleep$SleepEfficiency <- sleep$TotalMinutesAsleep / sleep$TotalTimeInBed
#sleeep duration categories
sleep$sleepquality<-ifelse(sleep$TotalMinutesAsleep<360,"Poor",ifelse(sleep$TotalMinutesAsleep<480,"Fair","Good"))

table(sleep$sleepquality)
```
b.Explore Descriptive Statistics.This gives you a snapshot of how well users are sleeping.
```{r}
library(dplyr)

sleep %>%
  summarise(
    avg_sleep = mean(TotalMinutesAsleep),
    avg_efficiency = mean(SleepEfficiency),
    good_sleepers = sum(sleepquality == "Good"),
    poor_sleepers = sum(sleepquality == "Poor")
  )
```

### 3.Analysing Heart Rate Behaviour
a.Summarize heart rate by day and user:
```{r}
library(dplyr)

daily_hr <- heartrate %>%
  group_by(Id, Date) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_hr = mean(Value),
    min_hr = min(Value),
    max_hr = max(Value),
    sd_hr = sd(Value) 
    # Heart rate variability (HRV)
  )
daily_hr
```
##  Data Visualization(share  phase)

```{r}
ggplot(activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories,color=TotalSteps)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  labs(title = "Bellabeat: Total Steps vs Total Calories")+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15L, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
```


There is a positive relationship between Total Steps and Total Calories. You can conclude that the more steps the participants took the more calories that were burned.

```{r}
ggplot(data = activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=TotalDistance,color=TotalDistance)) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x=TotalSteps, y=TotalDistance)) +
  labs(title = "Correlation between Total Steps & Total Distance") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15L, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
```



This visual depicts a positive correlation between total distance and total steps taken. The more steps the participants take the greater the distance is achieved.

```{r}
ggplot(activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=SedentaryMinutes, color=TotalSteps)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5)+
  labs(title = "Sedentary Minutes vs Total Steps Taken") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15L, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
```



The visual above shows a relationship between steps taken and sedentary minutes. This could help inform the customer segment to get up and start walking more or to measure the steps that one has already taken.


```{r}
ggplot(sleep, aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=TotalTimeInBed)) + 
  geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 3, alpha = 0.5, color = "#193E61") +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Bellabeat: Time Asleep vs Time in Bed", 
       caption = "source: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15L, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
```
  
  
  
  This visual below depicts the relationship between minutes asleep and the time spent in bed. It appears that participants have similar time spent asleep with the total time spent in bed.
  
## Conclusion 

### Key Findings from  Analyzing Daily Activity Patterns: 
 * Most users are not meeting recommended activity levels: Only 27.79% of users reach the 10,000-step goal, while 43% are sedentary, indicating low overall engagement.
  * Average daily movement is moderate: With ~6,500 steps and ~200 active minutes, users show potential for improvement through habit-building features.
* Movement and energy are positively correlated: More steps and active minutes lead to higher calorie burn, confirming the value of promoting Leaf’s activity tracking.

### Key Findings From Analyzing sleep behaviour

  Most users are not getting optimal sleep:
  
   * Only 116 users (25%) are classified as "Good" sleepers
   
 * 100 users (22%) have poor sleep (<6 hours)
 
 * The majority (194 users, 42%) fall into the "Fair" category (6–8 hours)
 * Average sleep duration is ~419 minutes (~7 hours)
 * Average sleep efficiency is 91.6%, which is relatively high—users tend to sleep well once    in bed
 
### Key Findings From Analyzing Heart Rate & Stress Indicator
* Average heart rate (avg_hr) ranges mostly between 70–86 BPM, suggesting moderate         cardiovascular activity across days.
 * Minimum heart rate (min_hr) values around 49–56 BPM likely reflect resting periods or sleep.
 * Maximum heart rate (max_hr) values reaching 150–182 BPM indicate periods of high exertion or stress.
 * Heart rate variability (sd_hr) ranges from 10 to 21, showing fluctuations in daily heart rate—lower values may suggest stress or poor recovery.


## Recommendations to the Bellabeat Marketing team

### Strategic Recommendations:

Based on the analysis of user behavior across activity, sleep, and heart rate data, several key patterns emerged that highlight opportunities for Bellabeat’s marketing team. These findings reveal gaps in user engagement, wellness habits, and product alignment—offering a data-driven foundation for targeted campaigns and feature positioning.

The following recommendations aim to help Bellabeat Leaf better connect with its users, improve wellness outcomes, and strengthen its market presence.

- Highlight Leaf’s step tracking and motivational features to the 43% of users classified as sedentary.
- Launch challenges or reminders to encourage users to reach the 10,000-step goal.
- Use positive reinforcement and gamification to build daily movement habits.

💤 2. Promote Sleep Coaching for Poor Sleepers

- Focus on the 22% of users sleeping less than 6 hours with personalized bedtime routines and wellness tips.
- Emphasize Leaf’s ability to track sleep efficiency and support better rest.
- Share content around sleep hygiene and recovery to improve sleep duration.

❤️ 3. Position Leaf as a Stress & Wellness Companion

- Use heart rate variability (HRV) insights to identify users with potential stress or poor recovery.
- Promote mindfulness and breathing features to users with low HRV or high max heart rates.
- Frame Leaf as a holistic wellness tracker—not just for fitness, but for emotional health too.

🔗 4. Leverage Correlation Insights for Messaging

- Reinforce the link between movement and calorie burn: “More steps, more energy burned.”
- Use distance and step data to- Use distance and step data to promote goal-based tracking (e.g., “Walk 5 km a day”).
- Encourage users to reduce sedentary minutes with nudges and movement reminders.

📊 5. Segment Users for Personalized Outreach

- Use activity, sleep, and heart rate data to create user personas (e.g., “Busy Sleeper,” “Weekend Walker,” “Stress Tracker”).
- Tailor marketing messages and app notifications based on user behavior patterns.
- Offer feature highlights or content bundles that match each persona’s needs.
